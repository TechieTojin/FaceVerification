# Face Verification System

This is a face verification system implemented in Python using **OpenCV** for real-time video capture and **DeepFace** for face recognition. The system compares the real-time captured face with a reference image to verify if they match. It can be used for authentication systems, security systems, or any application requiring face recognition.

## Features
- Real-time video capture using OpenCV.
- Face recognition using DeepFace.
- Displays "MATCH" or "NOT A MATCH" based on face verification.
- Can be customized with a different reference image for different users.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- DeepFace
- Keras
- TensorFlow

### Install Required Libraries

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install deepface
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
